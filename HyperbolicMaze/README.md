# 3D Hyperbolic Maze Engine

This project models a maze in a order-5 square tiling hyperbolic plane, and is built as a game where the user may navigate around the maze while it generates in real time. 
The project comes with a few options to visualize the maze around the player for interactive navigation. The standard settings uses a 3D-view
with surrounding walls, paired up with a hyperbolic bubble map to the side. 

New tiles and walls are generated as they becomes visible to the player, excluding the bubble map (adjustable with a parameter).
The maze is meant to be able to generate indefinitely, although there are still some bugs in the data structuring occuring at some locations.
